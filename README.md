This Angualr javascript project is a small project for demonstration of my work with MVC architecture with DOM. 
It is a HangMan game application.
In this user have given 6 chances to select a character to complete a particular word.Initially i ahve taken 5 words in the list.
If user pick a correct character then it will be displayed in front of correct guesses or incorrect guesses are displayed against incorrect guesses.
After successful completion of a word or if user fais to pick a correct guess for word, game will restart.
Enjoy the Game!!
